        			<h2>Zawinul Jaffer</h2>
        			<p> Mr. Zawinul, also known as 'Jafar the genie' by his band mates because he grants people's wishes using only his hands and a piano. The moment his fingers touch the keys of the piano, everything else seems redundant to the music played by Mr Zawinul. </p>
        			<p> Before he joined The Parakeets, Mr. Zawinul here was a street musician. It is said that he once stopped a bar fight gone wrong, using not his fists on faces but fingers on keys. That day he solved not one, but two problems. Amongst the crowd of entranced people was one Mr. Andy Thompson, the person who recruited Mr. Zawinul. This was almost two years ago and now they have become good friends and greater musicians. Ever since his addition to the band, Mr. Zawinul Jaffer is the newest addition.  </p>

        			<h2>Andy Thompson</h2>
        			<p>Andy is the Founder of The Parakeets, he has been a student of music since he was a child. He graduated the Monash University in 2013 before he set on his lifelong dream of forming a Band. According to Andy, he states the name of the band is derived from his childhood pet, a parakeet, which was quite melidous and he hopes to strike the same emotion in the heart of the audeince with his music.  
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				He started The Parakeets along with his childhood friend Idris, who is now the guitarist of the band and his college friend Niko, the Vocalist of the band, back in 2013.

        			<h2>Idris Elba</h2>
        				<p>Idris here is childhood friends with Andy, and he is often the recommended person to ask for advice pertaining life or music. He is probably the most established person in the band, since he has an extensive knowlege in the field of music adding to the fact that he studied at University College London(UCL).</p> 
        				<p>After completing his studies and working fro various music studios, he believed it was time to go back to Melbourne and as fortune has it, was the same time Andy was trying to get his Band off the ground. He is considered to be the Andy's first recruit.</p>
